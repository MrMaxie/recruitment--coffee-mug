- **Express.js**: Web framework for routing and handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) for interacting with MongoDB.
- **Zod**: Schema validation library used to validate incoming request data.

## How to Run

### Running Locally

1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
2. Run the application:
   1. `npm start` run the application on port `3000`
   2. `npm run dev` run the application on port `3000` with watch mode
   3. `npm run test` run the tests
   4. `npm run test -- --ui` run the tests with ui (webpage)

### Running with Docker

1. Start compose: `docker-compose up -d`

## Environment Variables

- **PORT**: Port on which the application will run. Default: `3000`
- **MONGO_URI**: MongoDB connection URI. Undefined by default. If not provided, the application will use an in-memory database. In production, it should be set to a valid MongoDB URI or application will throw an error.
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment in which the application is running. Default: `development`

  ],
  "totalAmount": 40

## Todo

- [ ] Move business logic for handling product stock changes etc to `services/` folder. Currently, the controllers are handling everything because there are no complex business logic requirements.
- [ ] Add authentication and authorization middleware. Also that means adding field customerId to the order model. Right now, anyone can create an order and customer information is just fake.
- [ ] More tests. Never enough tests ðŸ¤£
